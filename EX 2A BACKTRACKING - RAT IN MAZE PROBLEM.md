# EX 2A BACKTRACKING - RAT IN MAZE PROBLEM
## DATE:
## AIM:
To implement the Rat in a Maze problem using backtracking and find all possible paths from the start to the destination in a given maze.


## Algorithm
```
1. Initialize a solution matrix with zeros.
2.Start at the top-left corner and recursively explore possible paths.
3.Check if moving to a cell is safe (within bounds and open).
4.If reaching the bottom-right corner, mark the cell as part of the path.
5.If a path is found, print the solution matrix; otherwise, backtrack and return "Solution doesn't exist."
  
```

            return True

## Result:
The Rat in a Maze program executed successfully, and a valid path from the start to the destination was found and display.
